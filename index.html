        <p><b>Yusuf al-Azma</b> (pronunciation: ,<a href=""> [Yūsuf al-ʿAẓma]</a>
            1883 – 24 July 1920) was the Syrian minister of war in the governments of
            prime ministers Rida al-Rikabi and Hashim al-Atassi, and the Arab Army's chief of general staff under King
            Faisal. He served as minister of war
            from January 1920 until his death while commanding Syrian forces against a French invasion during the Battle
            of Maysalun.
            Al-Azma hailed from a wealthy Damascene landowning family. He became an officer in the Ottoman Army and
            fought on multiple fronts in World
            War I. After the defeated Ottomans withdrew from Damascus, al-Azma served Emir Faisal, the leader of the
            Arab Revolt, and was appointed
            minister of war upon the establishment of the Arab government in Damascus in January 1920.
